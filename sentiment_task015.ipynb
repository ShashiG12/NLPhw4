For example, the Naive Bayes Classifier needed a list of lists containing the featurized word vectors.\n",

Briefly reflect on how your partnership functioned--who did which tasks, how was the workload on each of you individually as compared to the previous homeworks, etc. We both split up the workload evenly by splitting the writing and coding tasks. Shashi did tasks 1 and 3, Sunny did tasks 4 and 5, and since task 2 was weighed the most heavily we collaborated heavily on it."
